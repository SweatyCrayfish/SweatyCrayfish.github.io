        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Welcome to this portfolio. Little bit about myself. I am motivated AI Engineer and as you already seen one of my goals is to become one if not the best expert in AI field. Today, I already wrote multiple python libraries that are actually fully functional softwares applications. One of my main experties is Generative AI. Due to high capicity for critical thinking I do get invloved in many key  projects that allows me to show shine my experties. One of them is ability to not only find but show a value of each model.</p>

          'LLM Deploy': 'Simple Deployment This project is a chatbot interface that integrates Hugging Face Transformers library with a Flask backend. It serves a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the user. The user can input text which is then processed by the Flask backend and fed into a pre-trained language model. The model generated text is then sent back to the frontend and displayed.',
          'Ubuntu Llama': 'Building dialogue systems, where a human can have a natural-feeling conversation with a virtual agent, is a difficult task in Natural Language Processing and the focus of much ongoing research. Some of the challenges include linking references to the same entity over time, tracking what’s happened in the conversation previously, and generating appropriate responses. This paper delves into our experiment in building such a virtual agent. We scrutinized various models such as CodeLLaMa, OPT, FlanT5 and Llama2. We outline the rationale behind our choice of Llama2-chat-instruct and how the model stands out due to its high-quality instruction-tuned capabilities and inherent ability for summarizing text. To further augment the quality of inferences drawn by the model, we implement a complete fine-tuning approach.. Furthermore, we will explore Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), demonstrating how it reduces memory and time resource requirements while maintaining model performance. Finally, we will assess these results using ROUGE metrics - a popular choice for evaluating models before and deploy the model to Hugging Face for serving.'
